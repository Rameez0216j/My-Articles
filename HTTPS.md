Great question! **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** protects data in transit using **encryption**, which prevents attackers from **reading or stealing** JWTs and other sensitive data.

## **🔐 Why Attackers Can’t Steal Data Over HTTPS?**
### **1. End-to-End Encryption (TLS/SSL)**
- HTTPS uses **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** or **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** to encrypt the communication between the **client (browser)** and the **server**.
- Even if an attacker intercepts the data, all they see is **garbled, unreadable ciphertext**, not the actual JWT or request data.

### **2. Protection Against MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attacks**
- In HTTP (without encryption), an attacker sitting between your **browser** and the **server** can **intercept and read** the data (MITM attack).
- With HTTPS, this is **impossible** because:
  1. **Encryption:** Data is encrypted before transmission.
  2. **Authentication:** The server provides a **TLS certificate** to prove its identity.
  3. **Integrity:** The encrypted message cannot be modified or forged.

### **3. Why Can't Attackers Decrypt HTTPS?**
- HTTPS encryption relies on **Public Key Cryptography**:
  - The **server has a private key** (kept secret).
  - The **client gets a public key** from the server’s SSL certificate.
  - A **secure handshake** happens, establishing an encrypted connection.
  - Even if an attacker intercepts this, they **don’t have the private key**, so they **can’t decrypt the data**.

## **🚫 What HTTPS Doesn’t Protect Against**
🔸 **Stolen Tokens from Local Storage:** If an attacker has access to the victim’s device, they can steal JWTs.  
🔸 **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Attacks:** Malicious JavaScript can extract JWTs if they are stored in `localStorage`.  
🔸 **Social Engineering & Phishing:** HTTPS won’t help if users **accidentally give** their tokens to attackers.

## **🛡️ Final Answer**
✅ **HTTPS encrypts data in transit, preventing attackers from reading or stealing JWTs.**  
🔐 **Even if an attacker intercepts the connection, they see only encrypted gibberish.**  
🚫 **However, HTTPS doesn’t protect against attacks on the client side (like XSS or stolen tokens).**  

Would you like a simple HTTPS request example to see this in action? 😊
